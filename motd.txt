FIRST NEWS IN OVER HALF A YEAR.

I've got some good news!

In the latest update I added an experimental mechanism that should give you 
better feedback when you do something wrong in the DarkRPMod. It should tell
who is responsible, what line the error occurs on and even gives hints about
what the cause could be or what you can do about it!

Try it out, give it a swirl. 
Update to the latest version of DarkRP through either GitHub or the workshop.

Still have problems with the errors? Head to http://forum.darkrp.com/ for help!
