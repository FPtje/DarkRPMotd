Today I removed the zombie mod for DarkRP. There are several reasons for this decision:
- Shit code: inefficient, shit interface and hard to maintain
- Not customisable, and a lot of work to make it customisable. You can't even have it on by default
- Very few people use it
- Other people probably want to make a zombie mod that's much better and can do a lot more

People who want to keep the old zombiemod can download it here:

Put in the darkrpmod's darkrp_modules folder. It will be exactly the same as before I removed it.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
