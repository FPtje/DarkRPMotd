FAdmin's spectate functionality has been ripped out of FAdmin and released separately. 
It's now called FSpectate. It's still in DarkRP by default, though. 
You'll notice some changes:

- Disabling FAdmin won't disable FSpectate. Disabling the "fspectate" module will.
- FSpectate can be activated with the !spectate chat command.
- This overrides ULX' spectate command. Run "ulx spectate" if you want ULX' spectate.

Everything else about it is still the same.

Seriously, try it out if you haven't yet.
