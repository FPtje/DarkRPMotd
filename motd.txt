DarkRP servers have changed over the years. Back in the day it was much more
focussed around building things and fooling around, doing the silliest
possible things. Currently the focus appears to have shifted towards raiding,
mugging and hitmen. There are many complaints about this, including from me.
DarkRP is much less fun than it used to be. The rules are too strict and leave
no room for creative roleplay. Players bitch too much about rules being broken
and admins are way too fucking keen on putting players on a roof when even the
slightest thing is beyond the precise protocol they are convinced the players
are to adhere to.

I've written a document on what I think is THE formula for a GOOD DarkRP
server. Please check it out:

UPDATE: Also do check out the slightly alternative view from Dogman_35. It's a
somewhat bigger read, but it shows some deeper insight and some criticism on
my own ideas: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=739536389


Also, remember that glualint-web is a thing and can tell you what's wrong with
your jobs and shipments (mostly):
