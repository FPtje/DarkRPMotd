EXPLOIT WARNING



PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR DARKRP WAS UPDATED AFTER JANUARY 11th 12:00 GMT!



A major DarkRP exploit was released on a hack forum through which hackers can gain access to RCon and many other things.
Many people know about this exploit and ACTIVELY ABUSE IT!
The exploit applies if you have MySQL set up for DarkRP.

It has been fixed in the latest version of DarkRP. Please update it ASAP! It is of utmost importance!
Please also change your MySQL credentials after updating!

The exploit is a terribly stupid mistake on my side. I'm very sorry. This should not have happened.
Feel free to call me a cunt on twitter: @FPtje.

This message will NOT go away when you update. You are safe from the exploit if you have updated after 
January 11th 12:00 GMT. 
This message will be removed on February 1st for it should have reached enough server owners by then.

This message is seen by everyone, including people who can exploit it. I've tried hiding the fix, but people
WILL find it if they look for it. This puts more pressure on server owners to update DarkRP. Sorry for that.
I decided against keeping it secret for it is already too widespread.



PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR DARKRP WAS UPDATED AFTER JANUARY 11th 12:00 GMT!
