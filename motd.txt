Hey guys, I've made some small but VERY useful changes to FAdmin:
    - Opening the FAdmin menu while spectating a player will now immediately
      open it on the player's page. 
      
      This means you can spectate someone, press tab and immediately 
      ban the fucker with a single mouse click!
    - You can copy a player's SteamID by right clicking their name 
      in the FAdmin menu
      
I've also made some more fixes to FAdmin spectate.
