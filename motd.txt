I've heard that there are some addons that mess with DarkRP's code. This is a bad thing in many, many ways.
If you know of any mods that do this, please send a message about it to @FPtje on twitter or create an issue on the github page. I'll get right on it.
The kind of mod I'm talking about is the kind you have to install by putting it in garrysmod/gamemodes/darkrp. 
Ring the alarm bells when an addon says that in the installation instructions.

Today I made a workaround for a pretty major GMod exploit. 
Please update, especially if you see people wandering around with huge steam messages as names.
