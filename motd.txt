DarkRP has updated! Everyone rejoice! Version 2.6.0 has been released!

The update will be installed automatically if you're on the workshop version of DarkRP.
People using the GitHub version will have to update manually. Download the latest version here:
https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP

Biggest changes:
- Better error mechanism. It tells you what's wrong and what to do when an error occurs.
- Jobs, shipments and all that stuff are more strictly checked. DarkRP will tell you when you've made mistakes.
- Lots of bug fixes, speed improvements and all that stuff depending on when you last updated.

ALL addons, the darkrpmod and your custom stuff will work on DarkRP 2.6.0. You don't have to worry about that.
Unless of course you edited DarkRP core files. Only then will everything break. 
    Obviously this happens because you are a terrible person.
