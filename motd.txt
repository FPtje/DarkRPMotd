Attention! Attention! Big news!

DarkRP 2.5.0 has been released!

If you're not on DarkRP 2.5.0 yet, read this:
http://wiki.darkrp.com/index.php/MigratingTo2.5.0

You can create an issue on the DarkRP github page if it is impossible to modify DarkRP without editing core files.

NOTE: the github issues page is NOT for asking questions like "HOW DO I MOD DARKRP!?"
There's a wiki for that:
http://wiki.darkrp.com/index.php/Main_Page

If you can't find it on the wiki, there's a forum for you to ask your questions:
http://forum.darkrp.com/

ONLY make an issue on the github page if you know what you're talking about.
