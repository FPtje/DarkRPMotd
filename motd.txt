DarkRP 2.6.1 Beta is now live on Github, through the normal download channels!
Biggest change: the default F4 menu now has CATEGORIES! YAY!

Some important notes here:
- 2.6.1 is in beta because I'm not completely sure it will work with all mods.
- The categories apply to the DEFAULT F4 MENU ONLY.
- Custom F4 menus WILL NOT BREAK though! They'll just ignore the categories.
- ALL your custom stuff will be in the "Other" category until you change it. See below.

When downloading the latest DarkRP, ALWAYS make a backup of your old DarkRP.
PLEASE read the wiki page on categories for a full explanation on how to use it.
Also, it tells you how to fix all things being in the "Other" category.

Today I removed the zombie mod for DarkRP. There are several reasons for this decision:
- Shit code: inefficient, shit interface and hard to maintain
- Not customisable, and a lot of work to make it customisable. You can't even have it on by default
- Very few people use it
- Other people probably want to make a zombie mod that's much better and can do a lot more

People who want to keep the old zombiemod can download it here:

Put in the darkrpmod's darkrp_modules folder. It will be exactly the same as before I removed it.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
