Guys guys guys! I just made some MAJOR changes to the performance of DarkRP!
It should be A LOT faster now, both on networking and serverside FPS.

LESS LAG! PEOPLE, REJOICE!

At the moment only the GitHub version has this update, so go update.
It's a big change, so I have NOT uploaded it to the workshop yet. I'm letting the people who use the GitHub version test it and report bugs.

I will upload it to the workshop if few bugs are reported within a week.

Here's a link to the workshop version of DarkRP:
