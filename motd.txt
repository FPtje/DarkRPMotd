Several things today:
1. The keypad checker was broken. I've fixed this on October 29th. Please update DarkRP to fix the keypad checker.
2. Some ATM mods contain exploits with which the player can get infinite money. Please disable or fix your ATM mods!
3. Some server owners have trouble with doors not saving. If you have this problem, please upload your sv.db file and talk about it here:
