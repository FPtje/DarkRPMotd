GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
DarkRP is now available on the workshop too! It's still experimental, please test it!
If it works you could have DarkRP update itself! Wouldn't that be great?

Have a link!

FAQ:
Will the version on GitHub still be updated?
> yes

Which one is more up to date?
> Both are equally up to date. Unless of course you use the Github version and never update. 
> With the Workshop you'll probably get your updates sooner than with manual updating.


Go try it out, report bugs on Github! Enjoy!
